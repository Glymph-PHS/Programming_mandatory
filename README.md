Programming assignment - Mandatory

Peter Husted Simonsen - 2018

These programs were made as a mandatory assignment for IT-Technology programming class.

1. The time zone converter gets the current time of GMT and then adds/subtracts seconds based on the location: CET, EST, CST, IST etc.

2. The IPv4 to IPv6 converter creates an IPv6 address from an IPv4 address. 
   This IPv6 address has the same amount of hosts as the IPv4 adress.

3. The mile to KM Fibonacci program calculates either KM or miles to each other via the Fibonacci sequence.
   It also calculates the Golden Ratio from 2 very large Fibonacci numbers.
